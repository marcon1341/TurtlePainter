<h1><b> 🐢 Turtle Painter</b></h1>

A simple Java-based drawing application (like a mini MS-Paint) that lets you draw geometric shapes (Square, Circle, Triangle, Hexagon) on a canvas using OOP, inheritance, abstraction, and interfaces.


 ##📋 Features

- Draw squares, circles, triangles, and hexagons in any color, size, or border width
- User-friendly command-line prompts for shape, position, color, and more
- Save your drawing as a PNG image
- Organized code using packages, abstract classes, and interfaces


 ##🛠️ Code Structure

- **MainApp.java**: Main program and menu system
- **World.java / Turtle.java**: Drawing engine and canvas logic
- **Shape.java**: Abstract base class for all shapes
- **IDrawable.java**: Interface that all shapes implement
- **Square.java, Circle.java, Triangle.java, Hexagon.java**: Shape subclasses


## 🎨 How to Use
